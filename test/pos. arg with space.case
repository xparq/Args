#!! OMFG, can't get this work... With BusyBox on Windows
#!! it either ignores the normal quotes, or it passes extra " chars,
#!! when trying these escaped quotes!... :-o Sigh... :-(
#!! With Git sh, the \" method at least produced a clean output.
RUN args-test --crap \"one two three\"

EXPECT "\
-------- NAMED (1):
crap
-------- POSITIONAL (1):
\"one two three\"
"

# !! There should be no fucking quotes in the output though, if the test runner worked proerly!...
