# Space Test Configuration

# This is actually a .sh (BB ash) script. So, no spaces around the "=", sorry!
# Also: Please don't leave the designated area! It will hurt.
#export SPACE_DEBUG=1
	# Default: not set -> the `DEBUG` fn. does nothing

# Main test executable (and its matching source) filename:
export TEST_NAME="args-test"

# Toolset for building stuff:
#export TOOLSET=msvc
#export TOOLSET=gcc
#!! SUBSETS ARE NOT YET SUPPORTED:
#export TOOLSET=gcc/64devkit
#export TOOLSET=gcc/...
	# Default: not set -> autodetect

# Preferred make tool/flavor (only these two yet!):
#export MAKE=nmake
#export MAKE=gnumake
	# Default: not set -> autodetect

# Common build dependencies (relative to the test dir; the stock makefile(s)
# will just glue this to the test case target's implied local dependencies):
# Be careful not to add wildcards too eagerly, as nonexistent matches would break the build!
# Put it in quotes if it doesn't seem to work! ;)
#!!Spaces in filenames are not yet supported here! -> #42
#!!Even worse: there can only be a single dependency item yet, as TEST_DIR will get prepended to it! :-/ -> #43
export BUILD_DEPS_COMMON=../*.hpp
	# Default: -

# Name of the test script file in a TC dir:
#TEST_CASE_SCRIPT_NAME=TEST.sh
	# Default: CASE

# For single-file TCs, recognize them by this filename suffix:
#TEST_CASE_FILE_EXT=.test.sh
	# Default: .case

#EXPECT_FILE_NAME=expected.results
	# Default: EXPECT

#!! Well, some POSIX emu envs (mainly: Git bash) will use incompatible path
#!! conversions for $PATH (/c/...), vs. $TEST_DIR (C:/...), so no use trying
#!! this... :-/ Good luck even figuring out the correct separator (: or ;)...
#!! BusyBox-w32 worked fine with this:
#!!export PATH="$TEST_DIR:$PATH"

# This would disable auto-prefixing cmd filenames for RUN with ./ to allow
# PATH lookup, which may be better done per test case, than here globally!
#export RUN_WITH_PATH_LOOKUP=1
