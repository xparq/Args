# This is actually a .sh (BB ash) script. So, no spaces around the "=", sorry!
# Also: Please don't leave the designated area! It will hurt.

#export TOOLSET=gcc/64devkit

# Be careful not to add wildcards too eagerly, as nonexistent matches would break the build!
# Put it in quotes if it doesn't seem to work! ;)
#!!Spaces in filenames are not yet supported here! -> #42
#!!Even worse: there can only be a single dependency item yet, as TEST_DIR will get prepended to it! :-/ -> #43
